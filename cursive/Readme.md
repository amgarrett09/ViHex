This is a slightly modified version of Alexandre Bury's 'Cursive' crate.
The original source can be found here:
https://github.com/gyscos/Cursive

In particular, I (Alex Garrett <alex@alexgarrett.tech>) created a new view
called HexArea (found in src/views/hex_view.rs) which is modified from the
original crate's 'TextArea' view. It has some custom functionality tailored
to the needs of this application.
